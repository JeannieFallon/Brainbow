# brainbow
A tool to create a visual representation of relative time spent on different tasks

/* In progress */

Brainbow is a tool to analyze worktime distribution using graphical and text feedback. In addition to a 
dynamic graphic of colored columns--the "brain rainbow" itself--the app also explicitly suggests what 
subject or project the user should work on next. 

31 May 2017: The data handling of the app is finished. However the visual crux of the app, 
the colorful Brainbow graphic, is still in progress. Currently the home page displays the 
raw data: subject name, color, subject time, and subject time as percentage of total time.

Users begin with a prompt to add subjects.

Users create custom subjects and assign a color to each.

After a work session, users log the number of minutes worked and choose which subjects comprised the work. 
Brainbow then distributes the work evenly among selected subjects.

Upon rerouting to the home page, the app will eventually display the proportion of each subject's worktime to the total 
worktime by way of colored columns. Although the data handling of the app is finished, the visual crux of the app--the colorful Brainbow graphic--is still in progress. Currently the home page displays the raw data: subject name, color, subject time, and subject time as percentage of total time.

Users can also start a fresh Brainbow analysis by resetting all subject times to 0:
