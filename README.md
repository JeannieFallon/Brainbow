# brainbow
A tool to create a visual representation of relative time spent on different tasks

/* In progress */

Brainbow is a tool to analyze worktime distribution using graphical and text feedback. In addition to a 
dynamic graphic of colored columns--the "brain rainbow" itself--the app also explicitly suggests what 
subject or project the user should work on next. 

Users create custom subjects and assign a color to each. After a work session, users log the number of 
minutes worked and choose which subjects comprised the work. Brainbow then distributes the work evenly 
among selected subjects. Upon rerouting to the home page, the app displays the proportion of each 
subject's worktime to the total worktime by way of colored columns. The percentage of relative worktime 
is represented by the height of each column.

31 May 2017: The data handling of the app is finished. However the visual crux of the app, 
the colorful Brainbow graphic, is still in progress. Currently the home page displays the 
raw data: subject name, color, subject time, and subject time as percentage of total time.
